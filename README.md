# Understanding-the-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence-by-Students
''Analysing how students use Artificial Intelligence in their academic work. The project explores AI adoption patterns across education levels, session durations, satisfaction ratings, and task typesâ€”providing data-driven insights into the role of AI in modern learning environments."

****OVERVIEW****

This project analyses how students across various academic levels and disciplines engage with Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to complete academic tasks. Using a detailed dataset and Power BI dashboard, I uncover insights into task types, usage patterns, satisfaction ratings, and factors that influence repeated use of AI. The aim is to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of AI-assisted learning from a user behaviour perspective.

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle.

****Project Objective****

The main objective is to answer:

"How do students engage with AI tools for academic support, and what factors influence their satisfaction and continued use?"
From this central question, I further explore:

â€¢	Which types of tasks are most supported by AI?

â€¢	What disciplines and student levels rely on AI the most?

â€¢	How effective is AI assistance in helping students complete their academic tasks?

â€¢	What is the relationship between session behaviour (duration, prompts) and satisfaction?

ðŸ“Š **Dataset Summary**

The dataset consists of two sheets: the first sheet which is the original dataset contains 10 columns and 10,000 of rows. 

The second sheet contains basic statistical analysis using the pivot table.

Sheet 1: Session-Level Data
Each row represents an individual AI usage session and contains:

â€¢	Student Level (e.g.,High school, Undergraduate, Graduate).

â€¢	Discipline (e.g., Biology, Business, Engineering, history, Maths, Computer science, Psychology).

â€¢	Task Type (e.g., Writing, Studying, Coding, Homework help, Research, Brainstorming).

â€¢	Session Details (Date, Length, Total Prompts).

â€¢	AI Assistance Level (scale of 1â€“5).

â€¢	Final Outcome (e.g., Assignment Completed, Gave Up, Idea drafted, Confused).

â€¢	Satisfaction Rating (1â€“5).

â€¢	Used Again (True/False â€” did the student return?).

Sheet 2: Summary Pivot Table

Aggregated data showing how many students used AI again versus not.
