# Understanding-the-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence-by-Students
''analysing how students use Artificial Intelligence in their academic work. The project explores AI adoption patterns across education levels, session durations, satisfaction ratings, and task typesâ€”providing data-driven insights into the role of AI in modern learning environments."

##OVERVIEW
This project analyses how students across various academic levels and disciplines engage with Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to complete academic tasks. Using a detailed dataset and Power BI dashboard, I uncover insights into task types, usage patterns, satisfaction ratings, and factors that influence repeated use of AI. The aim is to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of AI-assisted learning from a user behaviour perspective.

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle.
